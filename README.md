## 1. 🧾 Project Overview

### 1.1 Description  
A command-line Python tool that allows users to **encrypt and decrypt** text using the **Caesar Cipher** technique — enhanced with animated terminal feedback and user-friendly input prompts.

### 1.2 Key Features  
- 🔑 Encrypt or decrypt messages using custom shift values  
- 🌀 Animated CLI elements for engaging output  
- ✍️ Supports upper and lower case characters  
- 🧱 Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged  
- 📜 Purely educational and beginner-friendly code  
- 🚀 Fast and minimal — runs on any machine with Python

## 2. 🚀 Getting Started

### 2.1 Requirements  
Only one standard Python module needed — and it's already built-in!

### 2.2 Usage  
To run the Caesar Cipher tool:
```bash
python main.py
```

### 2.3 Execution Steps  
1. 🤖 Choose whether to **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**  
2. 💬 Input your message  
3. 🔁 Enter the **shift** value  
4. ✨ View the animated result in the terminal

## 3. 🔍 Example Output

A simple encryption example:
```
Input:  Hello World
Shift:  3
Output: Khoor Zruog
```

A decryption example:
```
Input:  Khoor Zruog
Shift:  3
Output: Hello World
```

## 4. 🧠 Educational Purpose

### 4.1 What is Caesar Cipher?  
The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known encryption techniques, where each letter in a message is **shifted a fixed number of positions** in the alphabet.

### 4.2 Why Use It?  
- 🧠 Great for learning encryption basics  
- 🏗️ Helps understand character manipulation in Python  
- 📚 Frequently used in CTFs and cybersecurity education
